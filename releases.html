    This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
    that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
    content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
    to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
    content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
    of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
    about making the content accessible and easy to read.

              Spinning heartbreak and loss into beautiful art
            </h3>
            <p class="cs-item-text">
              I'm not a huge poetry person, but this collection carries you
              through what I only imagine was the worst time in the authors life
              and you can feel the depths of the heartbreak and despair.
              Something so sad gets spun into something so courageous,
              beautiful, raw and heartfelt it leaves you in awe of the authors
              talent. Like straw to gold, heartbreak becomes beautiful art.

            <p class="cs-item-text">
              Purchased this book and read it,front to back in one sitting. I
              have been submerged in books and poems about divorce/infidelity
              and this one has to be the one that hit me the most. The way she
              puts her emotions into each page and is so transparent with her
              journey really spoke to me. Had me crying and cheering her on!
              Will definitely be watching out for her second book to release!!

              As someone who dealt with a similar situation as the author
              (infidelity while parenting a young child) I really felt heard by
              these poems. The flow throughout the book from beginning to end
              felt natural and closing the book at the end felt like closing a
              chapter of my life. Kudos to the author for turning a sad
              situation into a beautiful piece of art.

              Beautiful and well-written, you can feel the emotions coming
              through the pages. You can feel that the author put their heart
              and soul into this. Looking forward to the next volume!
